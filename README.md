# Dictionary

This code is a React-based dictionary application that allows users to search for the definition of a word.

The code starts by importing the necessary dependencies including the `React` library, `FaSearch`, `FaPlay`, and `FaHandPointUp` icons `from react-icons/fa`, and the logo and CSS for the application.

The main functional component `App` uses `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage the state of the application. The state variables include:

`word`: the word the user wants to search for
`searchMeaningTerm`: the term entered by the user in the search bar
`meanings`: the definition of the word
`errorMsg`: an error message to be displayed in case the word is not found
`isPlaying`: a boolean that keeps track of whether the pronunciation audio is playing or not
The `getWord` function uses fetch to get the definition of the word from the API https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/. The function handles errors and displays an error message if the word is not found.

The `handleWord` function is called when the user submits the search form. It sets the `word` state to the value of `searchMeaningTerm` and triggers a search.

The `handlePlay` function is used to play the pronunciation audio of the word. It uses the `Audio` API and sets the state of `isPlaying` to keep track of whether the audio is playing or not.

The `FirstLetterToUpperCase` function capitalizes the first letter of the word.

The returned JSX of the `App` component displays the search form, the word in upper case, and its definition.
